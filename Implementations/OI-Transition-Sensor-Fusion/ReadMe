To fuse selected datasets from GPS, Light and Magnetic sensors, please execute the 'fusion.m' file in MATLAB.

To select another datasets from other buildings, please redefine the paths in the MATLAB functions OI_GPS.m,

OI_Light.m and OI_Magnetic.m files. You should choose similar datasets with similar names.

Note 01: The ground truth for evaluations is based on the large signal edges of light or GPS uncertaity at transition points.

Note 02: In few datasets, there might be a problem in recording time by the smartphone in that e.g. data collection time interval of 
light might not intersect the time interval of GPS. In these cases, error might happen in fusion process. For fixing this issue, we are 
trying to upgrade our data collection application to have a better synchronization between different sensors.
