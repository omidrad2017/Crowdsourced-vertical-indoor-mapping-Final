To fuse selected datasets from GPS, Light and Magnetic sensors, please execute the 'fusion.m' file in MATLAB.

To select another datasets from other buildings, please redefine the paths in the MATLAB functions OI_GPS.m,

OI_Light.m and OI_Magnetic.m files. You should choose similar datasets with similar names.

Note: The ground truth for evaluations is based on the large signal edges of light or GPS uncertaity at transition points.
